# TurnLedonandoff
This simple project demonstrate how to turn an led on and off by pressing a push button.
One thing to keep in mind is that this project doesn't implement debouncing of the Button. So you might encounter some faults
when you press the Button for the led to go off, it might not off with one press. Or when you press it to on. That is because the button is debouncing internally.
And it has not come to a stable state yet. This can be fix in software or hardware for optimal functionality of the button. Next Project Am going to implement it.
